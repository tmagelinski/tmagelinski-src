abstract: "Current work in roll call modeling focuses on the legislative decision process and does not take advantage of the dynamic nature of legislation. Some political systems, such as Ukraineâ€™s Verkovna Rada, are inherently dynamic, and should be modeled as such. In the model proposed, the entire legislative body is modeled together and bills are viewed as a dynamic process. This model requires no contextual information about individual legislators and predicts the amount of favorable votes a bill will receive within 6.2%, on average. Additionally, we find differences in behavior of bills proposed by the President and those proposed by parliament members or the Cabinet. This work only uses a simple differential model, opening the door to the use of more complex models capable of leveraging contextual information in the future."
