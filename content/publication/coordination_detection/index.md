abstract: "The study of coordinated manipulation of conversations on social media has become more prevalent as social media’s role in amplifying misinformation, hate, and polarization has come under scrutiny. We discuss the implications of successful coordination detection algorithms based on shifts of power, and consider how responsible coordination detection may be carried out through synchronized action. We then propose a Synchronized Action Framework for detection of automated coordination through construction and analysis of multi-view networks. We validate our framework by examining the Reopen America conversation on Twitter, discovering three coordinated campaigns. We further investigate covert coordination surrounding the protests and find the task to be far more complex than examples seen in prior work, demonstrating the need for our multi-view approach. A cluster of suspicious users is identified and the activity of three members is detailed. These users amplify protest messages using the same hashtags at very similar times, though they all focus on different states. Through this analysis, we emphasize both the potential usefulness of coordination detection algorithms in investigating amplification, and the need for careful and responsible deployment of such tools."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We detail the challanges to performing coordination detecition on social media in a responsible way, and propose a framework to meet these challanges. The framework is then used to form a specific detector, which detects a number of coordinated campaigns in a real Twitter dataset."
