abstract: "In this study we compare two general methods of faction detection from Ukrainian Parliamentary roll call data, MacRae’s method and Gower’s method. Both methods were adapted to the special voting procedures and patterns of the Ukrainian Parliament, such as its nonbinary voting scheme. Our analysis shows that each method is viable for faction detection individually, and that both can be used in tandem for results with higher confidence. Viability was demonstrated through the construction of the cooperation network between official parties, and by listing key parliamentarians based on their centrality in the factionized voting network. While the party-party network is intuitive, it was found that a pair of key actors in one faction were from opposing parties."
